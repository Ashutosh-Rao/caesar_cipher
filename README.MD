# Caesar's Cypher
This program was built for the PSWC project mini project. 
It uses concepts such as multiple files, file handling, and uses GTK to display a GUI. 

It provies options for Encryption and Decryption of data using the classic Caesar's Cyphers method, one of the most basic forms of encryption.
It works by shifting the letters by a specified number, called the 'key'. Decryption is done by using the same key and reversing the same. 

All data is then logged to an Excel sheet for easy readability.
